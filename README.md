With the murderer of George Floyd in 2020, it became evident that police still discriminate against black-identifying people. The Stanford Open Policing Project, which contains information about the majority of traffic stops in some states, proved the theory. The program provided below is a mini-game. The point of the game is to make the user themself try to predict the most discriminated personâ€™s age, race, and sex is in the specific state. To make it a little easier, the user is allowed to have an answer to 3 questions related to whether race, age, or both, depending on the dataset. After the user receives the answer, they are asked to make their prediction of the age, sex, and race of the people who get the most traffic stops. Then, the user is given the right answer. The user also has an opportunity to view all the statistics of this specific state that is related to age, race, and sex.

To run the program, please download the datasets from this folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GzpdpojTrKdVZqmdf9Fc-1ytjNHF4Nyl?usp=sharing
